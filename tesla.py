# 692. Top K Frequent Words
# Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.
# Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. 
# Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Clarifications:


Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.


# Inputs:
words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2  # out = ["i","love"]
# words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4 # out = ["the","is","sunny","day"]
